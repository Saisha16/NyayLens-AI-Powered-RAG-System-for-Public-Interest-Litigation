# NyayLens - AI-Powered Public Interest Litigation Generator


>NyayLens is an end-to-end AI system that monitors public news sources, identifies potential public interest issues, maps them to constitutional rights and legal precedents, and generates structured **Public Interest Litigation (PIL) drafts** in a court-ready PDF format.

>This project focuses on **practical AI + system design**, not just models — combining NLP, semantic search, rule-based reasoning, and document generation.


## 🔍 Problem Statement

Public Interest Litigations often fail to be filed due to:
- Lack of legal awareness
- Manual effort in identifying constitutional violations
- Difficulty in mapping real-world events to relevant laws and precedents

NyayLens aims to **bridge the gap between news events and legal action** using AI.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
---
## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nyaylens.git
cd nyaylens
```

##🚀 Usage Flow

1. **Input:** Submit a news URL or select a pre-configured RSS feed.
2. **Extraction:** The system extracts and analyzes the article content.
3. **Classification:** Relevant rights and legal domains are identified.
4. **Retrieval:** Similar case laws and constitutional precedents are retrieved via RAG.
5. **Generation:** A structured PIL draft is synthesized based on legal formatting.
6. **Export:** Download the final PIL as a formatted PDF.
